## Product description:

This product is a multifunctional type, which can be used in battery internal resistance test, capacity test, power test, voltage and current test, monitoring DC parameters, percentage power display, modification of electric vehicles, RVs and many other uses. It is universal to measure any battery, whether it is a lead-acid battery.

Is it a ternary lithium battery or lithium iron phosphate or other types of DC batteries, as long as the operating voltage range (0~1000V) is basically universal, it can be widely used for measurement, and it can also be connected wirelessly. It can be connected to mobile phone/computer inspection APP to test when installed in the car. Data, more than the set voltage alarm, less than the set voltage alarm, over power alarm and other protection settings (if you need to cut off the power, please purchase a power off relay to control the cut off the power).

Torch has once again made a breakthrough for scientific and technological engineers, designing a new model of wide voltage and high current 1000V 1000A high-power large color screen Bluetooth wireless data transmission curve version of the multi-function electric energy meter, supporting 3 major upper computer connection system APP software, Android Apple PC computer Bluetooth
Wireless connection to kill applications, all kinds of measurement parameters are readily available, adapt to a variety of measurement applications, one machine with multiple uses.

## Product application:

This product is used to detect the capacity of various batteries, discharge and aging various power adapters, and detect the voltage, current, and power of various DC power supplies.

[TOC](#table-of-contents)

## Matters needing attention:

- When the test power supply is higher than 36V, please install a switch and pay attention to the
safety of electricity.
- If there is a user who purchases the battery power off relay module, please be sure to query the corresponding parameters of the current battery type under test to the DT24P background menu to set the accurate low and full values, so that it will reach you during the process of discharging or charging. When the set value exceeds the range, the system will send out a control voltage. The relay will automatically disconnect the power path to prevent the battery from being over-discharged or over-charged to damage the battery (the power-off relay needs to be purchased separately).
- If you enable the external power-off relay, use as much V as the independent power supply for
the relay.
- The product must be powered independently, 5-24V DC power supply, do not input battery
power

## Function interface introduction:
This product adopts the high-end and cost-intensive "2.4-inch high-definition large color Chinese and English display screen", designed a variety of functional interface content, Various parameters are displayed on one screen, and different function interfaces can be switched by short pressing the button. The interface diagram and introduction are as follows

1. Connect independent power supply (5-24V), the startup screen will appear

   ![](img/004.png)

   1. After powering on, short press the "+"/"-" key to switch between the following function interface and battery percentage interface.

2. Function interface:

   ![](img/005.png)

   1. Short press the "M" key to check the unit price of electricity.

   2. After entering the unit price adjustment of electricity bill, the unit price number of electricity bill jumps, press "M" shortly at this time Switch between decimal places, units, tens, and hundreds.

   3. Press "+"/"—" to adjust the number to increase/decrease.

3. Percentage interface:

   ![](img/006.png)

   More than 30% shows green, less than 30% shows yellow, less than 10% shows red (as on the rightPicture) After setting, you can judge whether the battery is.

   The blue light will only light up when there is power.

   To display the battery percentage, you need to hold down the M key and set the maximum voltage and minimum voltage in the background to automatically calculate the current battery voltage percentage.

   ![](img/007.png)

   The calculation formula is: battery percentage = (current voltage-minimum voltage) / (full charge voltage-minimum voltage) X100 %.
